            <h5>Current Student at University of Oregon Bootcamp</h5>
            <p>I'm just barely dipping my toe into the world of coding. This may surprise you but this masterpiece
                of a page is actually one of the first things I've ever built on my own... This may seem utterly 
                fantastical, but I assure you I'm saying true. 
                I value honesty, wit, and finding secrets and truths to problems and issues both digital and IRL. I 
                plan on improving my skills through this wonderful bootCamp ,see what I did there? That's what the kids 
                call camelCoding... No big deal. I've always been a creative thinker and a digitally inclined soul of the 
                vast binary sea. I love to learn and be engaged and work fast, and honing new skills.</p>

            AHHH... THAT's flavor country... Nothing quite like it. I'll be adding new repositories/projects and most likely, improving
