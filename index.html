    <h2>About</h2>
        <h3>
            I'm just barely dipping my toe into the world of coding. This may surprise you but this masterpiece
            of a page is actually one of the first things I've ever built on my own... This may seem utterly 
            fantastical, but I assure you I'm saying true. 
            I value honesty, wit, and finding secrets and truths to problems and issues both digital and IRL. I 
            plan on improving my skills through this wonderful bootCamp ,see what I did there? That's what the kids 
            call camelCoding... No big deal. I've always been a creative thinker and a digitally inclined soul of the 
            vast binary sea. I love to learn and be engaged and work fast, and honing new skills.

            This is my github page with my, scant for now, repositories that I've built mainly for class projects. 
            It's not much but it's mine. My litte code babies.

        <h3>
            Currently I'm enrolled in the full stack coding bootCampt that's being deliciously dolled out by UofO... 
            AHHH... THAT's flavor country... Nothing quite like it. I'll be adding new repositories/projects and most likely, improving 
            my portfolio along the way.
